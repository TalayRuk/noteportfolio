      <h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>

      <p>
        I had been in kitchen design field and nursing field. I worked as a kitchen designer for several years.
        I had life changes event and made me realized I would rather do something for my family.
        Thus I decided to get into the nursing field. However, I came to realize that it was not my cup of tea.
        I love math and problem solving. I feel that It's very rewarding to find the solution to the problem.
        I have patience for this type of thing. Therefore, I decided to once again start over, diving in and learn how to program.
        At Epicodus, I enjoy working in pair and rotating through out the class.

      <h2>PASSION</h2>

      <p>
        My passion is camping! I try to go camping as much as possible on the weekend. It is short but wellworth it for me.
        I enjoy swimming with my family and tiny bit of hiking (not their favorite). Next year my family and I will try off-road camping.
        We have to get our truck ready for off-road before we could do it.
