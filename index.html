              <h2>ABOUT ME!
              </h2>
                  <p>
                    I had been in kitchen design field and nursing field. I worked as a kitchen designer for several years.
                    I had life changes event and made me realized I would rather do something for my family.
                    Thus I decided to get into the nursing field. However, I came to realize that it was not my cup of tea.
                    I love math and problem solving. I feel that It's very rewarding to find the solution to the problem.
                    I have patience for this type of thing. Therefore, I decided to once again start over, diving in and learn how to program.
                    At Epicodus, I enjoy working in pair and rotating through out the class.

              <h2>PASSION</h2>
                  <p>
                    I love <strong>Camping!</strong> I try to go camping as much as possible on the weekend. It is short but wellworth it for me.
                    I enjoy <strong>Swimming</strong> with my family and tiny bit of hiking (not their favorite). Next year my family and I will try off-road camping.
                    We have to get our truck ready for <strong>Off-road</strong> before we could do it.
