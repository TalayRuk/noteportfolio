    <h2>ABOUT ME!
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had been in kitchen design field and nursing field. I worked as a kitchen designer for several years.
      I had life changes event and made me realized I would rather do something for my family.
      Thus I decided to get into the nursing field. However, I came to realize that it was not my cup of tea.
      I love math and problem solving. I feel that It's very rewarding to find the solution to the problem.
      I have patience for this type of thing. Therefore, I decided to once again start over, diving in and learn how to program.
      At Epicodus, I enjoy working in pair and rotating through out the class.

    <h2>PASSION</h2>
    <p>
      I love <strong>Camping!</strong> I try to go camping as much as possible on the weekend. It is short but wellworth it for me.
      I enjoy <strong>Swimming</strong> with my family and tiny bit of hiking (not their favorite). Next year my family and I will try off-road camping.
      We have to get our truck ready for <strong>Off-road</strong> before we could do it.
